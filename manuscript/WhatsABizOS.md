## Whats a Business Operating System
This book is a guide to way I like to think about solving busines problems with software. However, *"Business Problems"* is a challenging term to define. 
There have been a great number of books, podcasts and articles written on the changing state of businesses, industries and the technology that makes the function. 
Being a Technology Strategist at a consulting company means I have spoken with a large number of clients from a range of industry verticles. Almost everyone I've spoken to has had a giant shift in their industry.



### Innovators Dilema
There is a fantastic book by Clayton M. Christensen called *The Innovators Dilema*. It speaks of the struggle all companyes, including innovators have in chosing between protecting their existing market and being innovative. It details this challenge with the tale of the Hard Drive industry and describes how even innovators that come in to the industry and drive change eventually change to focus on protecting their core product, and leave themselves open to being the old incumbant that is displaced by the next wave of innovation. There is no way I can do this book justice with 50 paragraphs in this book so I suggest you go and read it. Or at least go add it to your cart on whatever book buying website you typically use.
