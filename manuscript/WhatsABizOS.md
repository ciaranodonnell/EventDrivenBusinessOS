Whats a Business Operating System
=================================

This book is a guide to way I like to think about solving busines problems with software. However, *"Business Problems"* is a challenging term to define. 
There have been a great number of books, podcasts and articles written on the changing state of businesses, industries and the technology that makes the function. 
Being a Technology Strategist at a consulting company means I have spoken with a large number of clients from a range of industry verticles. Almost everyone I've spoken to has had a giant shift in their industry.



## Innovators Dilema
There is a fantastic book by Clayton M. Christensen called *The Innovators Dilema*. It speaks of the struggle all companyes, including innovators have in chosing between protecting their existing market and being innovative. It details this challenge with the tale of the Hard Drive industry and describes how even innovators that come in to the industry and drive change eventually change to focus on protecting their core product, and leave themselves open to being the old incumbant that is displaced by the next wave of innovation. There is no way I can do this book justice with 50 paragraphs in this book so I suggest you go and read it. Or at least go add it to your cart on whatever book buying website you typically use. 

## What do I mean by Operating System

Lets take a look at the definition of an Operating System on Wikipedia

```
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
```

Well thats not super helpful. I dont think it makes it clear what I mean, perhaps there is more too it. It does go on to talk about *types of Operating Systems*:

```
Distributed

A distributed operating system manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer. The development of networked computers that could be linked and communicate with each other gave rise to distributed computing. Distributed computations are carried out on more than one machine. When computers in a group work in cooperation, they form a distributed system.
```

I think this makes it clearer. Typical in a large business, there are various organization units / departments that work/operating fairly independently. These departments are like individual components. They have specific inputs, actions and outputs that are different from the others, but overall they should be working together to achieve a common aim. 

The Distributed Operating System I think matches what we typically want to achieve with large scale systems in the enterprise.
