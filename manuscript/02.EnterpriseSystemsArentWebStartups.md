# Enterprises aren't web start-ups

One of the key messages that I have shared with clients, and some have shared with me is that these companies arent web startups.
They are existing business, some of which have been in operation for many years.
They have existing business, supported by existing systems.
This business might be with existing products, some of it with discontinued products.

I've worked with companies that have systems which have been running since the 1960s.
