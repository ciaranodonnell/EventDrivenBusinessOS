## Build vs Buy
The build vs buy conversation is a common one when wondering how to achieve your overall business goals. 
However, I personally feel that this conversation is an over simplification of the situation and is normally raised by someone with outdated thinking (best case) or an agenda to push (worst case). 

The reason I say Outdated thinking is the best case scenario is because if can be updated. Having a reasonable conversation with someone who isnt knowingly pushing an agenda is not really that challenging. If you can educate to the choice that you have, you can normally get them to move forward. 

Agenda pushers as really the bane of all reasonable conversation and path forward. They dont normally respond to your reasonable conversation or logic and will make strawman arguments or refuce to agree with you no matter what. The best you can with these people is to work them into a minority by convincing the reasonsable people around them.

## Build **and** Buy

So what are we trying to convince people of? I believe the reason conversation here is about build and buy. Knowbody really proposes building **everything** in a new system anymore. Building a message broker, or a database, or API Management suite is incredibly hard. It would be foolish to build any of these tools. So there is always buy.

However the most complicated conversations comes around standardized business processing tools like CRM, Loyalty Systems, or Commerce engines. This is where the conversation gets tricker and build/buy analysis can stall a conversation. I think buying these systems is normally a good idea. Finding the best one that can 
1) fit your business need
2) allow completed integratiion with other systems and complete access to the data inside it in real time. 

These are my basic requirements for any "buy" decision. They obviously have to fit the business need, and they *must* have an API that means I get push data in and suck it out on demand, better yet, they can push it out to me.
